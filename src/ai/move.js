 * move.js
 *
 * Encapsulates the RTS 'move' command. Targets can be a location or another
 * null. Variants include move and attack-move. When attack-moving, the null
 * will engage any enemies it encounters on its path. During normal moves,
 * the null will ignore any enemies it sees until it reaches its destination.
